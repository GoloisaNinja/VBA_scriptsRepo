# VBA_scriptsRepo

## Collection of useful VBA scripts

**Idea:** 

VBA scripts are largely built for specific datasets contained within specific workbooks.  However, with new projects, we often remember we've done something similar in the past and need only to look back upon that example to help further the new project.  I wanted to start compiling all my various VBA related projects in one collective space.  This repository will serve as library of sorts, containing both project specific code, as well as more general multi-purpose bas files that can be applied to various use cases. 

**Languages:** 

VBA - additionally, some files use some HTML to create tables and emails, etc. 

**Intent:** 

The intent here is simply to create a living repository of project VBA code that can be referenced for porfolio purposes.
Additionally, given (in my opinion) the somewhat unforgiving nature of VBA, this repo will serve to aid in future projects by providing direct examples of useful and innovative code.  No reason to reinvent the wheel.

**Branches:** 

This repo will only have a master branch and pull requests will not be a thing. 

**Future expansion:**

- [ ] I wrote many of these scripts years ago and they really should be refactored 
- [ ] There are really some gnarly functions that need to be refactored
- [x] Add a readme
- [x] Join Newbsanity.com
- [x] Make effort to continually add new scripts as new projects allow
- [ ] Add more multi-use scripts
- [ ] Add "how to add and implement .bas files in your VBA project" to Readme
